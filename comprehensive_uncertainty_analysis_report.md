# Comprehensive Uncertainty Quantification Analysis for Modification-Specific Peptides

## Overview

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty quantification for both retention time (RT) and MS2 fragment ion intensity predictions using pre-trained AlphaPeptDeep models. The analysis was performed on a subset of unmodified peptides from the `modificationSpecificPeptides.txt` dataset.

Two uncertainty quantification methods were employed:
1. **Simulated Monte Carlo Dropout**: Adding noise to predictions to simulate the effect of dropout
2. **Deep Ensembles**: Using multiple pre-trained models (generic, phospho, digly) to generate predictions

## Dataset

- Original dataset: 49 peptides from `modificationSpecificPeptides.txt`
- Filtered dataset: 47 unmodified peptides
- RT analysis: Used all 47 unmodified peptides
- MS2 analysis: Used a smaller subset (20 peptides) due to the higher computational complexity

## Retention Time (RT) Uncertainty Analysis

### Performance Metrics

| Method | PICP | MPIW | Mean Absolute Error | Mean Relative Error |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| MC Dropout | 0.0213 | 0.1918 | 32.6804 | inf% |
| Ensemble | 0.0213 | 0.2464 | 32.6590 | inf% |

### Key Findings for RT Prediction

1. **Low PICP (Prediction Interval Coverage Probability)**: 
   - Only about 2.1% of true values fall within the predicted confidence intervals
   - Ideally, PICP should be close to 95% for well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
   - This suggests significant under-estimation of uncertainty

2. **Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW)**:
   - MC Dropout: 0.1918
   - Ensemble: 0.2464
   - The ensemble method produces wider prediction intervals than MC Dropout

3. **High Mean Absolute Error**:
   - Both methods show high error rates (>32)
   - This indicates poor prediction accuracy on this specific dataset

4. **Peptide Length Impact on RT Prediction**:
   - Analysis of how peptide length affects prediction error and uncertainty
   - Results visualized in `length_impact_on_error.png` and `length_impact_on_uncertainty.png`

## MS2 Fragment Ion Intensity Uncertainty Analysis

### Key Findings for MS2 Prediction

1. **Fragment Ion Uncertainty**:
   - Both methods provide uncertainty estimates for each predicted fragment ion intensity
   - Visualized as error bars on the MS2 spectra plots

2. **Ion Type Differences**:
   - Analysis of uncertainty differences between b-ions and y-ions
   - Typically, y-ions show higher prediction confidence (lower uncertainty)

3. **Peptide Length Impact on MS2 Prediction**:
   - Longer peptides generally show higher uncertainty in fragment ion predictions
   - This is expected due to the increased complexity of fragmentation patterns

4. **Intensity vs. Uncertainty Relationship**:
   - Higher intensity fragments tend to have lower relative uncertainty
   - Low intensity fragments show higher variability in predictions

## Comparison of Methods

### RT Prediction

- **Ensemble Method**: Produces wider prediction intervals (higher MPIW) but achieves the same PICP as MC Dropout
- **MC Dropout**: More computationally efficient but provides narrower prediction intervals

### MS2 Prediction

- **Ensemble Method**: Generally provides more consistent uncertainty estimates across different fragment ions
- **MC Dropout**: Shows more variability in uncertainty estimates, particularly for low-intensity fragments

## Challenges and Limitations

1. **Domain Mismatch**: 
   - The pre-trained models may have been trained on different types of peptides or experimental conditions
   - The modification-specific peptides might have different characteristics than the training data

2. **Normalization Issues**:
   - The RT normalization approach used might not be appropriate for this dataset
   - The infinite relative error suggests problems with the normalization

3. **Uncertainty Calibration**:
   - The very low PICP indicates that the uncertainty estimates are not well-calibrated
   - The models are overconfident in their predictions

4. **Limited Dataset Size**:
   - The small number of peptides limits the statistical significance of the findings
   - A larger dataset would provide more robust conclusions

## Recommendations

1. **Model Fine-tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained models on a subset of the modification-specific peptides
   - This could improve prediction accuracy for this specific dataset

2. **Alternative Normalization**:
   - Explore different RT normalization approaches that better suit this dataset
   - Consider using the raw RT values directly if they are already on a comparable scale

3. **Uncertainty Calibration**:
   - Apply post-hoc calibration techniques to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates
   - Temperature scaling or isotonic regression could help calibrate the confidence intervals

4. **Expanded Dataset**:
   - If possible, increase the dataset size for more robust analysis
   - Include more diverse peptides to better understand the model's performance across different peptide properties

5. **MS2 Spectral Library Comparison**:
   - Compare predicted MS2 spectra with experimental spectra if available
   - This would provide a more direct evaluation of MS2 prediction accuracy

## Implementation Details

The analysis was implemented in two main scripts:

1. **`modification_specific_uncertainty_analysis.py`**:
   - Focuses on RT prediction uncertainty
   - Analyzes the impact of peptide properties on RT prediction

2. **`ms2_uncertainty_analysis.py`**:
   - Focuses on MS2 fragment ion intensity prediction uncertainty
   - Analyzes uncertainty by ion type and peptide length

Both scripts use the uncertainty quantification methods from `simple_pretrained_uncertainty_quantification.py`.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis reveals significant challenges in accurately predicting both retention times and MS2 fragment ion intensities for this specific peptide dataset. Both the MC Dropout and Ensemble methods show high error rates and poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates for RT prediction. For MS2 prediction, the uncertainty estimates provide valuable insights into the confidence of fragment ion intensity predictions, but further validation against experimental data would be beneficial.

The implementation of the recommendations outlined above could lead to improved performance and more reliable uncertainty estimates for both RT and MS2 predictions.
