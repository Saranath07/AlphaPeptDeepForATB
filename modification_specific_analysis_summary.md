# Summary of Uncertainty Quantification Analysis

## Key Findings

1. **Poor Model Performance**: Both uncertainty quantification methods (MC Dropout and Ensemble) showed high error rates (MAE ~32.7) and very low prediction interval coverage (PICP ~0.021), indicating that the pre-trained models do not perform well on this specific dataset.

2. **Uncertainty Estimates**: The ensemble method produced wider prediction intervals (MPIW = 0.246) compared to MC Dropout (MPIW = 0.192), but both methods severely underestimated the true uncertainty, as evidenced by the low PICP values.

3. **Infinite Relative Error**: The infinite mean relative error suggests issues with the normalization approach, possibly due to some normalized RT values being very close to zero.

## Visualizations Generated

The analysis produced several visualizations that provide insights into the model performance:

1. **Calibration Curves**: Show how well-calibrated the uncertainty estimates are
2. **RT Predictions with Uncertainty**: Display the predicted RT values with error bars
3. **Error vs. Uncertainty**: Analyze the relationship between prediction error and uncertainty
4. **Error Distribution Comparison**: Compare the error distributions of both methods
5. **Peptide Length Impact**: Visualize how peptide length affects prediction error and uncertainty

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Data-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained models on a subset of the modification-specific peptides to improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Alternative RT Normalization**: Explore different normalization approaches that might be more suitable for this dataset.

3. **Uncertainty Calibration**: Apply post-processing techniques like temperature scaling to calibrate the uncertainty estimates.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional peptide features that might improve prediction accuracy, such as hydrophobicity indices or amino acid composition.

5. **Model Architecture Adjustments**: Consider modifications to the model architecture to better handle the specific characteristics of this dataset.

## Next Steps

1. **Detailed Error Analysis**: Perform a more detailed analysis of which peptides have the highest errors to identify patterns.

2. **Experiment with Different Models**: Try different pre-trained models or even train a model from scratch on this specific dataset.

3. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to get more robust performance estimates.

4. **Expanded Dataset**: If possible, expand the dataset to include more peptides for a more comprehensive analysis.

5. **Transfer Learning**: Explore transfer learning approaches to adapt the pre-trained models to this specific dataset.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges of applying pre-trained AlphaPeptDeep models to specific peptide datasets and highlights the importance of proper uncertainty quantification and model calibration.
